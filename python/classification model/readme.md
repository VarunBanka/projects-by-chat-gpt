## Classification model

A machine learning model that can classify or predict outcomes based on a given set of data is called a "classification model" or a "prediction model," depending on the specific task it is designed to perform. A classification model is a type of machine learning model that is trained to predict a class label for a given input. For example, a classification model might be used to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their past behavior, or to classify an email as spam or not spam based on the words it contains. A prediction model is a type of machine learning model that is trained to predict a numerical value for a given input. For example, a prediction model might be used to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a certain disease based on their medical history, or to predict the price of a house based on its size and location.


## About this project

This code loads the Iris dataset from scikit-learn, splits the data into training and test sets, and builds a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using the training data. The model is then evaluated using the test data, and the test accuracy is printed to the console.

To classify or predict outcomes based on a different set of data, you would need to load your own data and modify the code accordingly. For example, you might need to change the feature and target variables to match the columns in your dataset, or you might need to use a different type of model that is better suited to your data.
