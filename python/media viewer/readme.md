## About this project

This code uses the requests library to make a request to the TMDb API and retrieve information about a movie with a given ID. The get_movie_info function takes a movie ID as input and returns a dictionary containing the title, release date, and overview of the movie. The main function prompts the user for a movie ID and then prints the movie information to the terminal.


## Usage

To use this code, you will need to sign up for an API key from TMDb and replace the API_KEY constant with your own key.
